      "🛒 RexBERT: ModernBERT except for E-commerce was just released. 4 Encoders (17M, 68M, 150M, 400M) trained on 2.3T tokens (with 350B E-commerce related tokens), easily outperforming base models on E-commerce tasks! Details:\n",

      "(17M, 68M, 150M, 400M), very usable sizes and 8k sequence length.\n",
      "- RexBERT is built on top of the excellent Ettin checkpoints after its first 2 phases, which consist of pretraining (1.7T tokens) and context extension (250B) tokens. The third (annealing) phase adds 350B tokens of E-commerce related tokens from an all-new dataset called 'Econ-niverse'. The authors published this dataset as well!\n",
      "- The models are \"base models\", i.e. they require finetuning. In a semantic similarity test, the finetuned RexBERT models heavily outperformed other finetuned models (Ettin, ModernBERT, EmbeddingGemma) at all each size, with identical train/eval conditions.\n",

      "2. If you're in a specific domain, further training Ettin or ModernBERT can be very powerful.\n",
